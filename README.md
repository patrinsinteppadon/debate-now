# DebateNOW

## Overview
DebateNOW is a gameified version of Spontaneous Argumentation (SPAR) Debate- a lighthearted 10-minute event where 2 members debate about casual topics (e.g. "Which is better: cats or dogs?" or "Was Thanos right?").

DebateNOW is a portable way to practice fundamental debate skills, like style, delivery, logic, reasoning, and thinking fast on your feet. It also functions as an accessible debate tool because of how little preparation is necessary to SPAR.

We hope you will find this web app useful in debate club, for public speaking classes, and even at home with friends.
